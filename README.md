# Image Recognition: Digits

Welcome to the Image Recognition repository! This project focuses on developing a neural network that can identify handwritten digits from images, as well as a GUI build in to handwrite digits. The neural network is designed to process and classify images of digits (0-9) using machine learning techniques.
